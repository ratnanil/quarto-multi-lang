    "text": "Vegetation is recorded by means of so-called “vegetation surveys” on defined sample patches of typically 0.1-400 m2. These contain information on all vascular plant species present and often also mosses and lichens, their proportions and environmental parameters recorded on site. This means that the information content of vegetation surveys is considerably greater and allows more in-depth analyses than observational data on individual species. For example, biodiversity mass or mean ecological indicator values can be determined and their changes in space and time analyzed."
